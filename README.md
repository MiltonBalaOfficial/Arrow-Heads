# Arrow-Heads

"Arrow-Heads" for inserting arrow-heads at different positions of a stroke be it a straight line or spline or any ordinary stroke.

## Installation Steps

1. **Place the folder** (`Arrowheads`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\xournalpp\plugins\` on Windows 
     *Note: The `AppData` folder may be hidden.*
   - `~/.config/xournalpp/plugins` on Linux or MacOS

1. **Place the icons** (`arrowheadStart.svg`, `arrowheadMiddle.svg`, `arrowheadEnd.svg`, `arrowheadBoth` and `arrowheadArrow.svg`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\share\icons\hicolor\scalable\actions` on Windows,
   - `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/actions/` on Linux or MacOS

2. **In the Xournal++ app**:
  Open menu `Edit > Toolbars > Customize`. You will find the copied icons in the `Plugins` section. Place them at a suitable location in the toolbar.

3. **Use the plugin** as needed


## Direction of Use

1. Draw an stroke, select it and click the icon as you wish.
  *Note: In case of general strokes and spline sometimes the ends are not proper so the arrowhead direction may differ. Just erase some points from the ends of the stroke then insert the arrow-head/arrow-heads, there is no problems with the straight line*

2. Shortcut keys (`Control` + `Alt` + `1 - 5`) are assigned for the actions, if you do not need just delete the `accelerator` from the coding in `Arrowhead.lua`
